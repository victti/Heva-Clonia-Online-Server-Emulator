# Heva-Clonia-Online-Server-Emulator
This requires my new vUtils dll, but its not released. If you want to test this by yourself, all you need is a TCP server on any port you want.

You can find the game's download on the internet.

To run the game just do `Heva.exe 127.0.0.1 27050(or any port you want)`.
